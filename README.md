# Password Complexity Checker
Created a tool using python program that will take a password input from the user and evaluate its strength according to some criteria, providing feedback on how strong or weak the password is. The strenth of a password is determined based on the following criteria:

1. Length of the password should be 8 characters or above.

2. Presence of both uppercase and lowercase characters.
   
3. Should contain numbers.
   
4. Should contain special characters.

The program assigns a strength rating ranging from "Very Strong" to "Weak" based on the number of criteria met. Users receive immediate feedback highlighting specific areas for improvement when their passwords fall short of optimal security standards. 

This interactive tool not only educates users about the importance of creating strong passwords but also encourages best practices in password management.
